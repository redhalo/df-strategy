# Introduction

This guide is an attempt to document my strategy for Fortress Mode in the game [Dwarf Fortress](https://store.steampowered.com/app/975370/Dwarf_Fortress/). I was heavily inspired by the unfinished works of MixTrak[1] [2] [3] hidden deep in the [Dwarf Fortress Wiki](https://dwarffortresswiki.org/). 

For my personal playstyle I use [DFHack](https://docs.dfhack.org/en/stable) for quality of life improvments and bugfixes. I don't like to use it's god-mode features with the exception of the [prospector](https://docs.dfhack.org/en/stable/docs/tools/prospector.html) command and the occasional [exterminate](https://docs.dfhack.org/en/stable/docs/tools/exterminate.html) command when the game unfairly throws a werebeast at me way too early to prepare.

The goals of this guide are to design an efficient fortress both in terms of self sufficiency and maintaining the best frame rate with the preset soft population cap of 200 dwarves. This guide is not aimed at first time players and assumes the reader has familiarity with Dwarf Fortress or is capable of research on their own.
