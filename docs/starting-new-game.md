# Starting New Game

## World Generation

We are going to use the preset world generation settings with the exception of changing the history length to 250 years. This will allow for larger civilizations and a more lived in world.

| Parameter                 | Value         |
| :------------------------ | :-----------: |
| `World map size`          | Medium        |
| `History Length`          | **250 years** |
| `Number of civilizations` | Medium        |
| `Maximum number of sites` | Medium        |
| `Number of beasts`        | Medium        |
| `Natural savagery`        | Medium        |
| `Mineral occurance`       | Everywhere    |

## Find Embark Location

Once generation is complete, we are going to click `Find embark location` and narrow down a good embark site. While some features may be desireable, too specific of a search may not provide results.

    The 2x2 dimension size provides enough resources for our fortress size while reducing lag and making the map easier to view.
