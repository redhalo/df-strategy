1.  This will allow for larger, established civilizations and a more lived in world.

Once completed, click `Keep world and return to main menu` to save the world first. 

## Find Embark Location

`Start new game in existing world` and select the newly created world. Click `Find embark location` and narrow down a good embark site. While some features may be desireable, too specific of a search may not provide results.

1.  The 2x2 embark size provides enough resources for our fortress while reducing lag and making the map easier to monitor.
2.  Good spirit embarks provide feather trees, sun berries and unicorns, which provide excelent resources.
3.  Required for steel production.
4.  Heavy aquifers just plain suck to deal with.
5.  An useful source of clean water.
6.  Required for glass production.
